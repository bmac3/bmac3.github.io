## About Me
Hello! I'm a CSE PhD student at UC Santa Cruz advised by Jeffrey Flanigan. My research area is in NLP, and I'm currently interested in studying the limitations of transformer models and trying to fix them. My research is largely rooted in studying models theoretically and then trying to observe theoretical phenomenon with interpretability techniques. 

I earned a BS in Physics at UC Santa Barbara and worked as a post-baccalaureate fellow with the Fusion Science and Ion Beam Technology group at Berkeley lab before starting my time at UC Santa Cruz.

My hobbies and interests include jiu-jitsu, surfing, dance, judo, and meditation.
